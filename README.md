# Classifier-to-predict-loan-case
In this project, I have build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.  

I have loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data to build the model and further classified the accuracy of each model to identify the best suited model for this particular case. 
  
I have made use of following algorithms to build the models:  
      k-Nearest Neighbour  
      Decision Tree  
      Support Vector Machine  
      Logistic Regression  
    
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:  
      Jaccard index  
      F1-score  
      LogLoass
